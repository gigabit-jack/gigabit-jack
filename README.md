# 🙋‍♂️ **About Me**

I'm an American expat living in New Zealand, and while I've been in IT for over 13 years now, I'm working toward a career shift to software engineering. I'm currently a student in the postbaccalaureate Computer Science program at Oregon State University.

I enjoy web development, data engineering, automation, and full-stack application design. I found Assembly to be much more entertaining than I expected, and I love the concept and design of APIs. Front-end work is just alright. Next up in my personal and job time are .NET and C#, though my future courses may not involve those.

I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to build useful tools, and can't wait to call myself a "real" developer!
