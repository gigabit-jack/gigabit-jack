# 🙋‍♂️ **About Me**

I'm an American expat living in New Zealand, and while I've been in IT for over 13 years now, I'm working toward a career shift to software engineering.

I enjoy web development, data engineering, automation, and full-stack application design. I found Assembly to be much more entertaining than I expected, and I love the concept and design of APIs. Front-end work is just alright. Next up are .NET and C#, though my future courses may not involve those so that may be personal work.

I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to build useful tools, and can't wait to call myself a "real" developer!
